# IMDB series into .csv

This is a script to fetch TV series data from IMDB while Cinemagoer is out of order at the moment (September 2024).

You input the name of TV series and this script fetches details into two .csv files:

series.csv: episode code / rating / episode name / date / plot summary

series_ratings: imdb ratings in one .csv line per season

The .csv files work nicely with conditional formatting in excel

Fetching code is based on help provided by oaokm at https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer/issues/517
